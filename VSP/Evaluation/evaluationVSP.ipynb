This vulnerability exists because the web UI does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid agent credentials.\\n\\n**Base Metric Values:**\\n\\n* **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The attack is delivered over the network.\\n* **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) - The attacker can easily exploit the vulnerability.\\n* **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L) - The attacker needs valid agent credentials, which implies a low level of privilege requirement.\\n* **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R) - The attacker needs the user to click a crafted link.\\n* **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) - The exploit does not require changing the security context.\\n* **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) - The attacker could access sensitive, browser-based information.\\n* **Integrity (I):** High (H) - The attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.\\n* **Availability (A):** Low (L) - The description doesn't mention an impact on availability, but the potential for script execution could lead to denial-of-service conditions, hence a low impact.\\n\\n**Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:**\\n\\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L \\n\"\n",

The receiver is supposed to respond to each retirement frame with a `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate.

An attacker can utilize a proxy to intercept this request and submit other data. Upon submitting this form, an email is sent to the administrator informing them that this user wants to delete their account. An administrator has no way of telling the difference between the actual user wishing to delete their account or the attacker issuing this for an account they do not control.\\n\\n**CVSS v3.1 Base Metrics:**\\n\\n* **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)** - The attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network.\\n* **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - The attack requires minimal effort. The attacker only needs to intercept the request and submit manipulated data.\\n* **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** - No special privileges are required for the attacker.\\n* **User Interaction (UI): None (N)** - No user interaction is required. The attack is automated.\\n* **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)** - The attack does not require changing the scope of the vulnerability.\\n* **Confidentiality (C): Low (L)** -  The attacker can potentially gain access to the user's account information.\\n* **Integrity (I): High (H)** - The attacker can delete the victim's account, causing significant damage to integrity.\\n* **Availability (A): None (N)** -  The vulnerability does not directly impact availability.\\n\\n**Final CVSS v3.1 Vector String:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N\\n\\n**Note:**  While the vulnerability could potentially lead to the loss of availability of the victim's account, the primary impact is the integrity violation.
