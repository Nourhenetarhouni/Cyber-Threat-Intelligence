,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.",CWE-22: Path Traversal,
,A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel that could allow an attacker to elevate privileges on affected systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing a specially crafted application on a target system. A successful exploit would allow the attacker to execute code with elevated privileges.,CWE-270: Unrestricted File Upload,
,A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel that could allow an attacker to elevate privileges on affected systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing a specially crafted application on a target system. A successful exploit would allow the attacker to execute code with elevated privileges.,CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management,
